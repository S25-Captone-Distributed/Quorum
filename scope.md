# Container Management System

**Project**: Container Management System

---

## 1. Overview

We are building a **container management system**—also referred to as the **Cluster Manager**—that handles the execution, runtime, and lifecycle of distributed services across multiple worker nodes. Users interact via:

- A **Web UI** dashboard to deploy, start, stop, and monitor services  
- A **Web API**/CLI for command‑line control

Key responsibilities include:

- **Cluster State & Scheduling**: Maintaining cluster-wide state, scheduling services onto nodes, ensuring resource availability.  
- **Execution & Runtime**: Managing the end‑to‑end lifecycle of Pods and containers: deploy, start, stop, health‑check, log, and route runtime requests.  
- **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**: Distributing control‑plane components, tracking node heartbeats, and automatic failover.

## 2. Architecture & Components

### 2.1 Component Diagram
We employ a Flowchart and a C4 “Execution System” diagram to illustrate how:

1. **Cluster (Node) Manager** – Receives user requests, tracks worker heartbeats, schedules jobs, and maintains cluster state.  
2. **Pod Manager** – Lives on each node; pulls images, creates/manages Pods, orchestrates container lifecycle.  
3. **Pods/Containers** – Each Pod may host one or more containers running the actual service.  
4. **Communication & Queue** – ZeroMQ for inter‑manager messaging; TCP for Pod ↔ Pod‑Manager heartbeats and runtime traffic.  
5. **Persistence Layer** – Central database (e.g., SQLite or etcd + Redis) to store cluster state, job assignments, logs, and heartbeats.  
6. **UI / Frontend** – Web dashboard showing cluster and service status.  
7. **Networking / Infrastructure** – Ensures reliable ZeroMQ and TCP channels across nodes.

## 3. Project Objectives

- **Maintain Cluster State**  
- **Track Worker Nodes** via periodic heartbeats  
- **Service Lifecycle Management**: Deploy, start, stop services on worker nodes  
- **Scheduling**: Allocate services to nodes based on CPU/RAM availability  
- **User Interfaces**:  
  - Web UI for monitoring and control  
  - Web API/CLI for automation  
- **High Availability**: Multiple control‑plane instances with leader election  

---

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 Deployment & Execution
- **Deploy**: Pull container images, create Pods, start containers  
- **Start/Stop**: Graceful and forced container lifecycle actions  
- **Runtime Requests**: Submit jobs or service calls, dynamically route to the right Pod  

### 4.2 Inter‑Service Communication
- **ZeroMQ**: Queue‑based messaging between Cluster Manager and Pod Managers  
- **TCP**: Direct Pod ↔ Pod Manager communication for heartbeats and request routing  

### 4.3 Logging & Monitoring
- Capture stdout/stderr logs for auditing and debugging  
- Monitor service health via heartbeat signals  

### 4.4 Scheduling & Load Balancing
- Resource‑aware scheduling algorithms  
- Even distribution of workloads  
- Dynamic auto‑scaling support (Phase 2)

### 4.5 Error Handling
- Timeouts, pull failures, connection drops  
- Node and control‑plane failover  
- Retry and escalation mechanisms  

---

## 5. Features

1. **Cluster State Dashboard** (Web UI & API)  
2. **Heartbeats**: Worker nodes send periodic pings to indicate aliveness  
3. **Service Scheduler**: Allocates, rebalances, and reschedules services  
4. **Pod Lifecycle Management**:  
   - Pull images  
   - Create/start/stop containers  
5. **Runtime Request Routing**:  
   - Assign job IDs  
   - Evaluate load & capacity  
   - Forward to correct Pod via TCP/ZeroMQ  
6. **Logging & Audit**: Persist container logs and status events  
7. **High Availability**: Leader election among control‑plane nodes  

---

## 6. Use Cases

### 6.1 Deploy Service
1. **User → Cluster Manager**: “Deploy” command with image & resource specs  
2. **Queueing**: Cluster Manager enqueues via ZeroMQ  
3. **Pod Manager**: Pulls image (Docker), creates Pod  
4. **Heartbeat**: Pod reports status back  
5. **Error Handling**: Pull failures, heartbeat timeouts, retries  
6. **State Update**: Persist success/failure to database and UI  

### 6.2 Start Service
1. **User → Cluster Manager**: “Start” command for deployed service  
2. **Cluster Manager → Pod Manager**: Instruct to start container  
3. **Container**: Executes `docker start`, confirms status  
4. **Error Handling**: Retry on no response or connection failure  

### 6.3 Stop Service
1. **User → Cluster Manager**: “Stop” command  
2. **Pod Manager**: Attempts graceful shutdown, or force‑kills  
3. **Status Update**: Reports back; logs incidents if forced  

### 6.4 Submit & Route Runtime Request
1. **User → Cluster Manager**: Job submission → assign job ID  
2. **Routing Decision**: Evaluate load, available ports, Pod health  
3. **Forward**: Pod Manager delivers request to selected Pod  
4. **Process & Respond**: Pod executes, returns result to user  
5. **Retries/Escalation**: On processing failures or timeouts  

### 6.5 Display Cluster State
- Worker nodes report CPU/RAM usage to Cluster Manager  
- Dashboard reflects real‑time resource utilization and service statuses

## 7. Communication & Routing Principles

- **Job Tracking**: In‑memory job registry with unique IDs, backed by persistent DB  
- **Reliable Messaging**: ZeroMQ for reliable queueing; TCP for low‑latency heartbeats  
- **Health‑Aware Routing**: Reroute away from nodes that miss heartbeats  
- **Service Discovery**: Real‑time detection of new Pods for routing updates  
- **Fault Tolerance**: Health checks, retry logic, and load balancing  

---

## 8. Error Cases & Handling

- **Container Pull Failure** → Report & retry with backoff  
- **Heartbeat Timeout** → Grace period + retry mechanism  
- **Node Failure** → Mark node as dead, suspend its services, reschedule jobs  
- **Control‑Plane Failure** → Leader election, failover to standby controllers  
- **Connection Drops** → Automatic reconnect attempts, escalate if persistent  
- **Graceful Shutdown Failure** → Force‑kill and log incident  

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (Phase Two)

1. **Dynamic Auto‑Scaling**: Auto‑register new nodes via etcd watchers and rebalance workloads  
2. **Checkpointing & Job Resumption**: Resume long‑running jobs from last checkpoint  
3. **Message Queue Layer**: Kafka/RabbitMQ for buffering during network partitions  
4. **Advanced Security**: API keys for nodes, mandatory TLS, stricter JWT policies  
5. **Optimized etcd Scaling**: Batch writes, Redis caching, and stale‑entry cleanup  

---

## 10. Interactions with External Components

- **UI / Frontend**: Web dashboard & CLI for user commands and status visualization  
- **Database / Persistence**: Central store for logs, heartbeats, state, and metrics  
- **Networking / Infrastructure**: Underlying support for ZeroMQ/TCP channels, TLS encryption  
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Integration with external systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for alerts and dashboards
