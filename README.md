## Overview

Team Execution is responsible for orchestrating and managing job execution across worker nodes within the cluster. This includes scheduling, dispatching, and ensuring tasks are executed efficiently while maintaining fault tolerance and high availability. The system handles job retries, reassignment on node failures, and concurrency constraints to optimize resource utilization. By tracking execution state, enforcing job dependencies, and providing observability into job performance, Team Execution ensures reliable and scalable task execution across the distributed cluster.
